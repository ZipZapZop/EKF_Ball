# EKF_Ball

Extended Kalman Filter created in python based on the example from Christopher S. Bretherton of the University of Washington. 

An explanation of the filter for his class can be found [here](https://atmos.washington.edu/~breth/classes/AS552/lect/lect26.pdf).
A (cleaner) MATLAB implementation of the code can be found [here](https://atmos.washington.edu/~breth/classes/AS552/matlab/lect/html/kalman2.html#1).

My exercise of cloning the code into Python has been done for learning purposes and is incomplete.
